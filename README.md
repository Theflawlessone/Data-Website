# Data-Website
This is the first website that I have ever created. I created this as a project for my Math for Data Science class. It contains some projects that I have worked on in the course.
Majority of the projects found on this website were created when I was beginner in coding (close to no knowledge).
</n> Projects that can be found on this website: 
- Coin Flip Tool (You press a button and the coin "flips")
- Random Picker Tool (You enter a list of items and it picks a single item out)
- Calendar Tool (You enter a date and activity and it pops up on a weekly calendar (Sunday-Saturday))
- To-do List (You enter activities that need to be done and change the light to either green or red to indicate if it needs to be done or remove it from the list by hitting the red x)
- Trash Night (This indicates which night is trash night (Thurday))
- Dice (You press a button and the dice "rolls" and picks a side)
- Countdown Timer (You enter a certain amount of time and it countdowns to 0 and makes a noise to indicate that the timer is done)
